# Building

The javascript files required by RCloud are now bundled together to
reduce bugs (``I forgot to add the new .js file again'') and to reduce
the number of HTTP requests. 

This means that you will have to recompile the bundles every time the
javascript has changed. Currently the HTML sources are using the
un-minified javascript, so all that is needed is to go into js/ and
type make.
