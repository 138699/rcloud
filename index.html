<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
      <p>
	RCloud is an environment for collaboratively creating and sharing data
	analysis scripts in R. Much like <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a>,
	<a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/notebook.html">iPython notebooks</a>
	and <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>, RCloud
	provides a notebook interface that lets you easily record a session
	and annotate it with text, equations, and supporting images.
      </p>

      <p>Unlike these other systems, RCloud:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>lets you easily browse other users's notebooks, comment on
	  notebooks, fork notebooks, star notebooks, and use them as function
	  calls in your own notebooks.</li>
	<li>provides an environment in which R packages can create rich HTML
	  content (using, for example, <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a> and
	  <a href="http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/">dc.js</a>).</li>
	<li>provides a transparent, integrated version control system. In
	  essence, RCloud never forgets what you did. If you need low-level
	  access to RCloud notebooks, you can simply clone the associated git
	  repository. This is because RCloud notebooks are
	  <a href="https://gist.github.com">Github gists</a>.
	</li>
      </ul>
