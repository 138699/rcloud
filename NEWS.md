* Convention: the `call.R` entry point is used for general RPC into R.
  Documentation for notebooks that are intended to be used as `call.R`
  targets should be in the form of RMarkdown cells, so that
  `view.html?notebook=` shows the documentation for
  `call.R?notebook=`. KNOWN BUG: `call.R` currently ignores all
  RMarkdown cells, so if you mix R content into your cells, they will
  currently be ignored.

* Feature: File upload now supports upload-to-notebook. When the
  "upload to notebook" checkbox is selected, the file is uploaded
  to the github gist instead of to the local filesystem. As a result,
  it can be seen by anyone, regardless of permissions. This can be
  used to install custom stylesheets (as per feature description
  below)

* Feature: Notebook interests (the set of notebooks you find
  interesting enough to keep close) is now denoted by starring and
  unstarring notebooks. We now explicitly keep the
  user-notebook-starring relation so we can do recsys things with it
  in the future.

* Feature: In view mode (view.html), appending &quiet=1 will hide the
  navbar and greeting message. This makes it easier for view.html URLs
  to be effectively used as iframes in different websites.

* Feature: In view mode (view.html), rcloud inserts any stylesheets
  present in the notebook into the main document. Currently, the only way
  to add stylesheets to a notebook is to directly edit the github
  gist. This will change in the near future.

* Feature: added a `github.user.whitelist` option to rcloud.conf to
  allow only a subset of Github users to login to any given rcloud
  deployment. If no whitelist is given, all users are allowed in
