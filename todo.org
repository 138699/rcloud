* TODO
** test search
** Save button (actually a 5s timeout between saves or something like that would be better)
** Resize editor in notebook cell
** As notebook is edited but not saved, title should have asterisk next to it
* Ideas
** saved cells could contain an image of the output! (if we save the HTML content before sending, we can display it on search results...)
*** But what about wplot, wgeoplot, etc?
